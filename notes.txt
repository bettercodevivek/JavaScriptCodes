javascript accepts both single quotes as well as double quotes in getElementById and others.
In js, you can use it to even change src of img by using onclick only.
similarly like we changed innerHTMl of para.
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, 
because script interpretation slows down the display.

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
1.Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
2.Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
3.Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
4.Writing into the browser console, using console.log().

Using document.write() after an HTML document is loaded, will delete all existing HTML( basically
,normally when you use document.write() toh kuch change  nahi hoga but when you create a button which onclick 
triggers the document.write() in that case existing HTML gets deleted)

JavaScript does not have any print object or print methods.
You cannot access output devices from JavaScript.
The only exception is that you can call the window.print() method in the browser to print the content of the current window.

The var keyword was used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
The let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
The var keyword should only be used in code written for older browsers.

Variables declared with let have Block Scope
Variables declared with let must be Declared before use
Variables declared with let cannot be Redeclared in the same scope

let and const have block scope.

let and const can not be redeclared.

let and const must be declared before use.

let and const does not bind to this.

let and const are not hoisted.

Accessing a function without () returns the function and not the function result:
