javascript accepts both single quotes as well as double quotes in getElementById and others.
In js, you can use it to even change src of img by using onclick only.
similarly like we changed innerHTMl of para.
In HTML, JavaScript code is inserted between <script> and </script> tags.
Scripts can be placed in the <body>, or in the <head> section of an HTML page, or in both.
Placing scripts at the bottom of the <body> element improves the display speed, 
because script interpretation slows down the display.

JavaScript can "display" data in different ways:
1.Writing into an HTML element, using innerHTML.
2.Writing into the HTML output using document.write().
3.Writing into an alert box, using window.alert().
4.Writing into the browser console, using console.log().
